# Microsoft 365 compliance program

Microsoft runs on trust and Microsoft 365 customers require world class security and privacy functions within their products. The thorough auditing of Microsoft 365 assures customers that the security functions, data handling practices, associated policies, and tooling work in harmony to meet customer needs for certifications, accreditations, and attestations. Microsoft 365's internal compliance program is designed to ensure security and privacy are considered at all phases of the development process.

Each service begins the assurance lifecycle with the execution of three related efforts: security, privacy, and compliance. Microsoft directs these efforts by using assessments. The security assessment ensures that all security tools, application policies, and functions are applied and appropriately configured. The privacy assessment reviews all data a service collects, transmits, and stores. It confirms strict data handling is in place and that it adheres to regional privacy requirements. Finally, the compliance assessment verifies that the services satisfy all the relevant compliance requirements for the customers they wish to serve.

Let's take a deeper dive into each of these components to understand their role in the overall process.

## Security

The security assessment is owned by the Microsoft 365 Security Team and is designed to identify all the security solutions that service teams need to install and configure. Microsoft 365 has developed solutions for service teams to secure each individual service and connect them to the centralized systems that helps protect Microsoft as a whole. These solutions include identity and access management, anti-malware software, central logging, TLS configuration, and others. Service teams are also required to create data flow diagrams for threat modeling to help map potential attack vectors. The Microsoft 365 Security Team is available to service teams for guidance and perform a final review and approval of the service security functions.

## Privacy

Privacy focuses on customer data the service team transmits, processes, and stores. Tasks include identifying data types collected, retention periods, classification, and any third-party interactions. Once service teams complete their tasks, a dedicated privacy manager and a lawyer perform a review of the data handling functions. Threat models are also used to safeguard against unexpected data leakage. The privacy manager must provide official approval and verification of privacy assessment completion.

## Compliance

Many customers must have certain industry compliance requirements met to use a cloud service such as Microsoft 365. The main goal of the compliance assessment is to ensure that the service and any downstream dependencies meet the proper compliance requirements for applicable public accreditations. These accreditations may include the [ISO 27001 Information security standard](/compliance/regulatory/offering-iso-27001), [SOC II Type 2](/compliance/regulatory/offering-soc-2), [FedRAMP](/compliance/regulatory/offering-FedRAMP) for government customers, and others.

The final step of the compliance assessment is the Final Trust Review conducted by Microsoft's Trust Architects. This provides an all-encompassing check of a service's security, privacy, and compliance posture. It verifies each service is properly secured, follows best practices, meets all relevant regulatory requirements, and all identifiable risks have been adequately addressed. Additionally, the holistic relationship to all other services and environments is considered at this point. Service teams present to the team of Trust Architects who evaluate and test the service readiness. Any concerns discovered in this review must be remediated prior to final approval.

Teams developing a new service are encouraged to participate in a consultative review session with the Trust Architects before completing the other assessments. The service teams receive advice on their design, including guidance on avoiding potential pitfalls and blockers prior to beginning any development.

Once the security, privacy, compliance efforts are complete and approved, a service may become generally available to customers and begin the operational certification work. In most cases, regulatory and industry standard certification and accreditation is sought quickly after becoming available to customers.
