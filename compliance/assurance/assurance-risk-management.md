# Risk management overview

## How does Microsoft assess and manage risk across the enterprise?

Risk management is the process of identifying, assessing, and responding to risk. Risk management at Microsoft is designed to anticipate new threats and provide ongoing security for our cloud systems and the customers who use them.

Microsoft's risk management activities are governed by the Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) program. ERM enables the overall enterprise risk management process and works with management across the enterprise to identify and ensure accountability for Microsoft's most significant risks. It focuses on anticipating, assessing, and reporting risks to inform Microsoft's business strategy and drive risk mitigation and accountability.

Microsoft ERM coordinates risk management activities across the enterprise to enable business units to independently facilitate consistent and comparative risk assessments. This provides Microsoft the ability to aggregate and report risk information in a consolidated manner for management. ERM provides business units in Microsoft with common methodologies, tools, and goals for the risk management process. Microsoft 365 and other engineering groups and business units leverage these tools to conduct individual risk assessments as part of their own risk management programs under the guidance of ERM.

## How does Microsoft 365 work with ERM?

The Microsoft 365 Risk Management program follows ERM guidance to manage risks across Microsoft 365 services. The program focuses on aligning the ERM framework with existing Microsoft 365 engineering, service operations, and compliance processes, making the Risk Management program more effective and efficient. Microsoft 365's risk management activities ultimately roll up into and inform the ERM process.

As part of risk assessment activities, the Microsoft 365 Risk Management program analyzes design and operating effectiveness of controls implemented as part of the Microsoft 365 Controls Framework (Framework). The Framework is a rationalized set of controls that, when properly implemented along with supporting compliance activities, allows engineering teams to comply with key regulations and certifications.

## How does Microsoft 365 manage and assess risk in its online services?

As part of ongoing risk assessment activities, the Microsoft 365 Risk Management program conducts interviews with the service teams that design, build, and operate Microsoft 365 services to identify current risks and areas of concern. These activities, along with analysis of continuous monitoring data, audits, and other sources, are used to develop risk assessment reports that identify current and possible future risks to long-term business goals. Risk assessment reports provide a high-level overview of Microsoft 365's risk posture based on our findings and feedback from Microsoft 365 service teams. Together with similar reports from other business units, Microsoft 365 risk assessment reports contribute to and inform ERM program risk assessments.

Microsoft 365 Trust is a group responsible for supporting assurance operations related to policy compliance, security requirements, and risk management. Microsoft 365 Trust works to identify new risks as they emerge and monitor known risks and risk responses. Feedback from Microsoft 365 service teams and continuous monitoring data from Microsoft 365 environments inform this process. The success and failure of risk responses are tracked to develop and inform analysis of risk likelihoods and impacts. Regular risk review meetings with risk owners enable Microsoft 365 Trust to update and manage risk responses.

## Related external regulations & certifications
