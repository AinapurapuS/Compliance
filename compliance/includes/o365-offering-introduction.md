Office 365 is a multi-tenant hyperscale cloud platform and an integrated experience of apps and services, that is available or announced to customers in several regions worldwide. Most Office 365 services enable customers to specify the region where their Customer Data will be located. Microsoft may replicate Customer Data to other regions within the same geo for data resiliency, but Microsoft will not replicate Customer Data outside the chosen geo (e.g. the United States).
