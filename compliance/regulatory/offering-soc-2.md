# System and Organization Controls (SOC) 2 Type 2

## SOC 2 Type 2 overview

System and Organization Controls (SOC) for Service Organizations are internal control reports created by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA). They're intended to examine services provided by a service organization so that end users can assess and address the risk associated with an outsourced service.

A SOC 2 Type 2 attestation is performed under:

- SSAE No. 18, Attestation Standards: Clarification and Recodification, which includes AT-C section 105, *Concepts Common to All Attestation Engagements*, and AT-C section 205, *Examination Engagements* (AICPA, Professional Standards).
- SOC 2 Reporting on an Examination of Controls at a Service Organization Relevant to Security, Availability, Processing Integrity, Confidentiality, or Privacy (AICPA Guide).
- TSP section 100, 2017 Trust Services Criteria for Security, Availability, Processing Integrity, Confidentiality, and Privacy (AICPA, 2017 Trust Services Criteria).

In addition, the Office 365 SOC 2 Type 2 attestation report addresses the requirements set forth in the Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) Cloud Controls Matrix (CCM), and the Cloud Computing Compliance Criteria Catalogue (C5:2020) created by the German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI).

Office 365 SOC 2 attestations are based on rigorous comprehensive third-party examinations (also known as *audits*) conducted by an independent AICPA accredited CPA firm. At the conclusion of a SOC 2 audit, the auditor renders an opinion in a SOC 2 Type 2 report, which describes the cloud service provider's (CSP) system and assesses the fairness of the CSP's description of its controls. It also evaluates whether the CSP's controls are designed appropriately, were in operation on a specified date, and were operating effectively over a specified time period. Office 365 SOC 2 Type 2 reports are relevant to system Security, Availability, Processing Integrity, and Confidentiality.

### Frequently asked questions

**How often are Office 365 SOC reports issued?**

Microsoft commissions a full SOC 1 Type 2 and SOC 2 Type 2 examination of Office 365 annually. The auditor's reports on these examinations (also known as audits) are issued as soon as they're ready after that audit.

Because Microsoft doesn't control the investigative scope of the examination nor the timeframe of the auditor's completion, there's no set timeframe when these reports are issued. The reports are usually issued a few months after the end of the period under examination. Microsoft doesn't allow any gaps in the consecutive periods of examination from one examination to the next.

Microsoft also commissions a mid-year SOC 1 Type 1 and SOC 2 Type 1 examination of Office 365 for new Microsoft services that have been issued since the last SOC Type 2 audit.  Type 1 audits don't look back over a period of performance.

Due to the sophisticated nature of Office 365, the service scope is large if examined as a whole. This can lead to examination completion delays simply due to scale. Microsoft organizes all the examinations described above into 2 categories: Core Services and Microservices. Microsoft issues reports scoped to each examination.

SOC Type 2 audits examine a rolling 12-month *run window* (also known as audit period or more formally *period of performance*) with examinations conducted annually for the period 1-October through 30-September of the next calendar year. The examination starts promptly after the period of performance is complete.

Microsoft also issues *bridge letters* (also known as *gap letters*). These are self-attestations by Microsoft, not reports based on examinations by the auditor. Bridge letters are issued during the current period of performance that isn't yet complete and ready for audit examination. Microsoft issues bridge letters at the end of each quarter to attest our performance during the prior three-month period. Due to the period of performance for the SOC type 2 audits, the bridge letters are typically issued in December, March, June, and September of the current operating period.

**Where can I get the Office 365 SOC audit documentation including bridge letters?**

For links to audit documentation, see the audit report section of the [Service Trust Portal](https://servicetrust.microsoft.com). You must have an existing subscription or free trial account in Office 365 or [Office 365 U.S. Government](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/government/request/) to log in. You can then download audit certificates, assessment reports, and other applicable documents to help you with your own regulatory requirements.

**Where can I find an assessment of the Cloud Security Alliance CCM controls implementation?**

Microsoft commissions an examination of Office 365 to be based on the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) Trust Services Principles and Criteria, including security, availability, confidentiality, and processing integrity, and the criteria in the Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) Cloud Controls Matrix (CCM). 

The objective is to assess both the AICPA criteria and requirements set forth in the CCM in one efficient inspection. The Office 365 SOC 2 Type 2 audit incorporates the CCM controls assessment as required by the CSA STAR attestation. For more information, see the Office 365 SOC 2 Type 2 attestation report.

**Where can I see management responses to any exceptions noted?**

Most examinations have some observations on one or more of the specific controls examined. This is to be expected. Management responses to any exceptions are located towards the end of the SOC attestation report. Search the document for 'Management Response'.

**Where can I see user entity responsibilities?**

User entity responsibilities are your control responsibilities necessary if the system as a whole is to meet the SOC 2 control standards. These are located at the very end of the SOC attestation report. Search the document for 'User Entity Responsibilities'.
