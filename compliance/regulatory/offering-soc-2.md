# System and Organization Controls (SOC) 2 Type 2

## SOC 2 Type 2 overview

System and Organization Controls (SOC) for Service Organizations are internal control reports created by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA). They are intended to examine services provided by a service organization so that end users can assess and address the risk associated with an outsourced service.

A SOC 2 Type 2 attestation is performed under:

- SSAE No. 18, Attestation Standards: Clarification and Recodification, which includes AT-C section 105, *Concepts Common to All Attestation Engagements*, and AT-C section 205, *Examination Engagements* (AICPA, Professional Standards).
- SOC 2 Reporting on an Examination of Controls at a Service Organization Relevant to Security, Availability, Processing Integrity, Confidentiality, or Privacy (AICPA Guide).
- TSP section 100, 2017 Trust Services Criteria for Security, Availability, Processing Integrity, Confidentiality, and Privacy (AICPA, 2017 Trust Services Criteria).

In addition, the Office 365 SOC 2 Type 2 attestation report addresses the requirements set forth in the Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) Cloud Controls Matrix (CCM), and the Cloud Computing Compliance Criteria Catalogue (C5:2020) created by the German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI).

Office 365 SOC 2 attestations are based on rigorous independent third-party audits conducted by a reputable CPA firm. At the conclusion of a SOC 2 audit, the auditor renders an opinion in a SOC 2 Type 2 report, which describes the cloud service provider's (CSP) system and assesses the fairness of the CSP's description of its controls. It also evaluates whether the CSP's controls are designed appropriately, were in operation on a specified date, and were operating effectively over a specified time period. Office 365 SOC 2 Type 2 reports are relevant to system Security, Availability, Processing Integrity, Confidentiality, and Privacy.
