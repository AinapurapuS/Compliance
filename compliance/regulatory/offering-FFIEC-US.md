# Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC)

## FFIEC overview

The Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) is a formal interagency body comprising five banking regulators that are responsible for US federal government examinations of financial institutions in the United States. The FFIEC Examiner Education Office publishes IT Examination Handbooks intended for field examiners from FFIEC member agencies.

The [FFIEC Audit IT Examination Handbook](https://ithandbook.ffiec.gov/it-booklets/audit.aspx) contains guidance for these examiners to assess the quality and effectiveness of IT audit programs of both financial institutions and TSPs. Specifically, it includes mention of SOC 1, SOC 2, and SOC 3 attestation reports of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) as examples of independent audit reports. However, the FFIEC recommends that financial institutions not rely solely on the information contained in these reports, but also use verification and monitoring procedures discussed in detail in the [FFIEC Outsourcing Technology Services IT Examination Handbook](https://ithandbook.ffiec.gov/it-booklets/outsourcing-technology-services.aspx).

## Microsoft and FFIEC

Microsoft Azure, Microsoft Power BI, and Microsoft Office 365 are built to meet the stringent requirements of providing cloud services for financial services institutions. Azure provides financial institutions with SOC 1 Type 2, SOC 2 Type 2, and SOC 3 attestation reports produced by an independent auditing firm to help customers meet their own FFIEC compliance obligations. For example, the [SOC 1 Type 2 attestation](./offering-soc-1.md) is performed under:

- SSAE No. 18, Attestation Standards: Clarification and Recodification, which includes AT-C section 320, *Reporting on an Examination of Controls at a Service Organization Relevant to User Entities' Internal Control Over Financial Reporting* (AICPA, Professional Standards).
- SOC 1 Reporting on an Examination of Controls at a Service Organization Relevant to User Entities' Internal Control Over Financial Reporting (AICPA Guide).

The AICPA SSAE 18 standard replaced SAS 70, and it is appropriate for reporting on controls at a service organization relevant to user entities internal controls over financial reporting. This is the formal audit that financial institutions can leverage for third-party reviews of technology service providers when pursuing their own FFIEC specific compliance obligations for assets deployed on Azure. It includes auditorâ€™s opinion on control effectiveness to achieve the related control objectives during the specified monitoring period.

Moreover, Azure has developed an Excel-based cloud security diagnostic tool intended to expedite a risk assessment that a financial institution may want to conduct relative to Azure services. The tool is based on a spreadsheet featuring 19 separate domains that identify requirements set forth in relevant standards and financial services-related regulations, including the FFIEC IT Examination Handbooks.  The risk assessment tool is pre-populated with explanations for how Azure complies with requirements applicable to cloud service providers, and can assist customers in meeting their own FFIEC compliance requirements.

Also available to customers is the Azure FFIEC cloud security diagnostic workbook companion, which offers guidance on the use of Azure services and considerations for customer compliance with FFIEC requirements

### Frequently asked questions

**Can I use Microsoft compliance with SOC standards to meet the FFIEC compliance obligations for my institution?**

To help you meet these obligations, Microsoft supplies the specifics about our compliance with SOC standards as described above. However, ultimately, it is up to you to determine whether our services comply with the specific laws and regulations applicable to your institution. The FFIEC also advises that 'users of audit reports or reviews should not rely solely on the information contained in the report to verify the internal control environment of the TSP. They should use other verification and monitoring procedures as discussed more fully in the [Outsourcing Technology Booklet](https://ithandbook.ffiec.gov/it-booklets/outsourcing-technology-services.aspx) of the FFIEC IT Examination Handbook.'
