# Trusted Information Security Assessment Exchange (TISAX) Germany

## About TISAX

To help secure the ever-increasing connectivity in the automotive industry, the German Association of the Automotive Industry ([Verband der Automobilindustrie](https://www.vda.de), VDA) developed a catalogue of criteria for assessing information security. The VDA Information Security Assessment ([German](https://www.vda.de/de/themen/sicherheit-und-standards/informationssicherheit/informationssicherheit-sicherheitsanforderungen.html) and [English](https://www.vda.de/en/topics/safety-and-standards/information-security/information-security-requirements)) is based on the fundamentals of the international ISO/IEC 27001 and 27002 standards adapted to the automotive industry. In 2017, it was updated to cover controls for the use of cloud services.

VDA member companies used this instrument both for internal security assessments and for assessments of suppliers, service providers, and other partners that process sensitive information on their behalf. However, because these evaluations were handled individually by each company, it created a burden on partners and duplicated effort on the part of VDA members.

To help streamline evaluations, the VDA set up a common assessment and exchange mechanism, the [Trusted Information Security Assessment Exchange](https://www.enx.com/tisax/) (TISAX). The catalogue of underlying TISAX requirements, Questionnaire for Checking Information Security Assessment and Information Security Management, Vers. 4 ([German](https://www.vda.de/de/services/Publikationen.html) and [English](https://www.vda.de/en/services/Publications.html)), provides common standards for IT security measures, and enables companies registered in TISAX to share assessment results. The VDA entrusted a neutral third party, the [ENX Association](https://portal.enx.com/en-US/en-en/TISAX/tisaxassessmentresults/), with TISAX implementation. In that capacity, it accredits audit providers (auditors), maintains the accreditation criteria and assessment requirements, and monitors the quality of implementation and assessment results.

## Microsoft and TISAX

European automotive companies rely on trust to develop, build, and operate new cars. They use the Trusted Information Security Assessment Exchange (TISAX) to provide a common information security assessment for internal analysis, an evaluation of suppliers, and as an information exchange mechanism. An independent ENX-accredited auditor completed the TISAX assessment of Microsoft datacenters and operations centers against TISAX specifications and IT security requirements. These TISAX-certified datacenters provide the physical infrastructure for Microsoft online services described in the assessment report. These services include Azure, Dynamics 365, and Microsoft 365.

Automotive companies around the world can now evaluate the Microsoft TISAX assessment to create cloud solutions that integrate strong information security and data protection. Companies can use the Microsoft TISAX assessment to confidently exchange data with suppliers who use workstations based on Microsoft 365 cloud services.

Microsoft provided a self-assessment of its cloud services, and the auditor performed two levels of assessment based on that. (The assessment level determines the depth of the evaluation and the methods the auditors use.)

- Microsoft data centers in Northern Europe (Dublin region, Ireland), Western Europe (Amsterdam region, Netherlands), Germany (Berlin, Frankfurt) and Korea (Busan, Seoul) were assessed at Level 3 (AL3). The audits included a thorough verification of security processes, a comprehensive onsite inspection and in-person interviews. An AL3 assessment is required for data with a high protection requirement, such as data classified as strictly confidential or secret, data from crash test and flow simulations, and AI (artificial intelligence) systems.
- Selected Microsoft global datacenters were assessed at Level 2 (AL2) based on remote interviews. An AL2 assessment is required for data with a high need for protection, such as data classified as confidential.

## Audits, reports, and certificates
