# Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) & Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act

## HIPAA and the HITECH Act overview

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) and the regulations issued under HIPAA are a set of U.S. healthcare laws that establish requirements for the use, disclosure, and safeguarding of individually identifiable health information. The scope of HIPAA was extended with the enactment of the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act in 2009.

HIPAA applies to covered entities (specifically, health care providers, health plans, and health care clearinghouses) that create, receive, maintain, transmit, or access patients' protected health information (PHI). HIPAA further applies to business associates of covered entities that perform certain functions or activities involving PHI as part of providing services to the covered entity or on behalf of the covered entity.  

When a covered entity engages the services of a cloud service provider, such as Microsoft, the cloud service provider would be a business associate under HIPAA. Moreover, when a business associate subcontracts with a cloud service provider to create, receive, maintain, or transmit PHI, the cloud service provider also becomes a business associate.

## Microsoft, HIPAA, and the HITECH Act

HIPAA regulations require that covered entities (defined under the Rules) enter into agreements with business associates to ensure that PHI is adequately protected. This agreement is called a Business Associate Agreement. Among other things, a Business Associate Agreement establishes the permitted and required uses and disclosures of PHI by the business associate, based on the relationship between the parties and the activities or services being performed by the business associate. To support our customers compliance with HIPAA when utilizing Microsoft enterprise products and services, Microsoft will enter into Business Associate Agreements with its covered entity and business associate customers.

There is currently no certification standard that is approved by the Department of Health and Human Services to demonstrate compliance with HIPAA or the HITECH Act by a business associate. However, Microsoft enables customers in their compliance with HIPAA and the HITECH Act and adheres to the Security Rule requirements of HIPAA in its capacity as a business associate. Moreover, Microsoft enters into Business Associate Agreements with its covered entity and business associate customers to support their compliance with HIPAA obligations.  

## Third-party certifications

Microsoft services covered under the BAA have undergone audits conducted by accredited independent auditors for the Microsoft ISO/IEC 27001 certification and the HITRUST CSF certification.

Microsoft enterprise cloud services are also covered by FedRAMP assessments. Microsoft Azure and Microsoft Azure Government received a Provisional Authority to Operate from the FedRAMP Joint Authorization Board; Microsoft Dynamics 365 U.S. Government received an Agency Authority to Operate from the US Department of Housing and Urban Development, as did Microsoft Office 365 U.S. Government from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

### Frequently asked questions

**Can my organization enter into a BAA with Microsoft?**

Yes. Microsoft offers its covered entity and business associate customers a Business Associate Agreement that covers in-scope Microsoft services.

The [Microsoft HIPAA Business Associate Agreement](https://servicetrust.microsoft.com/ViewPage/MSComplianceGuideV3) is available through the Microsoft Online Services Data Protection Addendum by default to all customers who are covered entities or business associates under HIPAA. See 'Microsoft in-scope cloud services' on this webpage for the list of cloud services covered by this BAA.

The HIPAA Business Associate Agreement is also available for in-scope Microsoft Professional Services upon. Contact your Microsoft services representative for more information.

**Does having a Business Associate Agreement with Microsoft ensure my organization's compliance with HIPAA and the HITECH Act?**

No. By offering a Business Associate Agreement, Microsoft helps support your HIPAA compliance. However, using Microsoft services does not on its own achieve HIPAA compliance. Your organization is responsible for ensuring that you have an adequate compliance program and internal processes in place, and that your particular use of Microsoft services aligns with your obligations under HIPAA and the HITECH Act.

**Can Microsoft use my organization's Business Associate Agreement?**

No, Microsoft cannot use a customer's Business Associate Agreement. Because we offer hyperscale, multi-tenant services that are standardized for all our customers, we must operate in a consistent manner. The Microsoft HIPAA Business Associate Agreement closely reflects how we operate. Accordingly, in order to address the needs of the healthcare industry, Microsoft collaborated with a consortium of academic medical centers and other public and private sector entities within healthcare to create a Business Associate Agreement that aligns with our scale service offerings and meets the needs of customers.

**How can I get copies of third party audit reports?**

The [Service Trust Portal](https://www.microsoft.com/trustcenter/STP/default.aspx) provides independently audited compliance reports. You can use the portal to request audit reports so that your auditors can compare Microsoft's cloud services results with your own legal and regulatory requirements. Azure customers can also retrieve Azure certificates and audit reports in the Azure portal through the [audit reports blade in Azure Security Center](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/AuditReportsBlade).

**How can I learn more about how Microsoft supports compliance with HIPAA and the HITECH Act?**

To assist customers with this task, Microsoft has published these guides:

- HIPAA/HITECH Act implementation guidance for [Azure](/azure/governance/blueprints/samples/hipaa-hitrust-9-2/) for privacy, security, and compliance officers and others responsible for HIPAA and HITECH Act implementation, describes concrete steps your organization can take to maintain compliance.
- [Practical guide to designing secure health solutions using Microsoft Azure](https://aka.ms/azureindustrysecurity) helps you better understand what it takes to successfully adopt a cloud service in a secure manner.
