# European Union Model Clauses

## European Union Model Clauses overview

European Union (EU) data protection law regulates the transfer of EU customer personal data to countries outside the European Economic Area (EEA), which includes all EU countries and Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway. On a practical level, compliance with EU data protection laws also means that customers need fewer approvals from individual authorities to transfer personal data outside of the EU, since most EU member states do not require additional authorization if the transfer is based on an agreement that complies with the Model Clauses.

## Microsoft and European Union Model Clauses

The European Union (EU) [General Data Protection Regulation](/compliance/regulatory/gdpr) (GDPR) regulates the transfer of customer personal data to countries outside the European Economic Area (EEA), which includes all EU countries and Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway. Microsoft offers customers the EU [Standard Contractual Clauses](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/standard-contractual-clauses-scc_en) (SCC) (also known as EU Model Clauses) that provide specific guarantees around transfers of personal data for in-scope services. The EU Model Clauses are used in agreements between service providers (such as Microsoft) and their customers to ensure that any personal data leaving the EEA will be transferred in compliance with the GDPR.

In July 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) invalidated the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework for transfers of personal data from the EU to the United States. However, the EU Model Clauses continue to provide a valid mechanism for the transfer of personal data from the EU and EEA, as well as from Switzerland and the United Kingdom. Microsoft makes the EU Model Clauses available to customers as described in the Microsoft Online Services Terms (OST) [Data Protection Addendum](https://aka.ms/DPA) (DPA).

## Frequently asked questions

**Why is compliance with the Model Clauses important?**

A service provider that commits contractually to the Model Clauses gives its customers assurance that personal data will be transferred and processed in compliance with EU data protection law. Use of the Model Clauses also means that customers need to get fewer approvals from individual data-protection authorities to transfer personal data outside the EU.

**Where can I see compliance information for Microsoft services?**

Compliance is a contractual commitment. Microsoft Standard Contractual Clauses are available to all cloud customers in the [Online Services Terms](https://aka.ms/Online-Services-Terms); for other services, see your existing agreement with Microsoft.

**What is a 'sub-processor'?**

A sub-processor is someone who processes personal data following the data controller's instructions, and the terms of the EU Model Clauses and the subcontract. Microsoft customers—independent software vendors (ISVs), in particular — are sometimes themselves data processors. In those instances, Microsoft is the sub-processor.

**Where do I start with my own organization's compliance efforts?**

You can enter an agreement such, as the [Online Services Terms](https://aka.ms/Online-Services-Terms), or explore amending your existing agreement to incorporate the Standard Contractual Clauses.
