# Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)

## FERPA overview

The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) is a US federal law that protects the privacy of students' education records, including personally identifiable and directory information. FERPA was enacted to ensure that parents and students age 18 and older can access those records, request changes to them, and control the disclosure of information, except in specific and limited cases where FERPA allows for disclosure without consent.

The law applies to schools, school districts, and any other institution that receives funding from the US Department of Education â€” that is, virtually all public K-12 schools and school districts, as well as most post-secondary institutions, both public and private.

Security is central to compliance with FERPA, which requires the protection of student information from unauthorized disclosures. Educational institutions that use cloud computing need contractual reassurances that a technology vendor manages sensitive student data appropriately.

## Microsoft and FERPA

FERPA does not require or recognize audits or other certifications, so any academic institution that is subject to FERPA must assess for itself whether and how its use of a cloud service affects its ability to comply with FERPA requirements. In the Online Services Terms [Data Protection Addendum](https://aka.ms/DPA) (DPA), Microsoft agrees to be designated as a 'school official' with 'legitimate educational interests' in customer data as defined under FERPA. Customer data would include any student records provided through a school's use of Azure. When handling student education records, Microsoft agrees to abide by the limitations and requirements imposed by 34 CFR 99.33(a) just as school officials do.  Microsoft has published guidance documentation to assist Azure customers with satisfying their FERPA compliance requirements.

### Frequently asked questions

**Why is FERPA important?**

This US federal law mandates the protection of the privacy of students' education records. It also gives parents and eligible students access to those records and the ability to correct them, as well as certain rights related to the release of records to third parties.

**What compliance implications do COPPA and CIPA have on Azure?**

COPPA and CIPA are additional laws intended to protect the privacy of children; however, they are not directly applicable to Azure. The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) is a U.S. federal law enacted to protect the privacy of children under 13. It is managed by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). COPPA applies to websites and online services directed to children and stipulates that these sites and services must require parental consent for the collection and use of any personal information belonging to children. The Children's Internet Protection Act (CIPA) was enacted to address concerns about children's access to harmful content over the Internet. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) issued rules implementing CIPA and defined requirements for schools and libraries subject to CIPA. Customers enquiring about COPPA and CIPA in the context of Azure adoption should review the section titled Educational Institutions in the Online Services Terms [DPA](https://aka.ms/DPA) where we explain that customers are responsible for obtaining any parental consent for any end user's use of Microsoft online services.
