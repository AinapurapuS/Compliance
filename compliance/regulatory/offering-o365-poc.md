# ISO 27001:2013

ISO/IEC 27000 family of standards provide a framework for policies and procedures that include legal, physical, and technical controls involved in an organization’s information risk management processes. ISO/IEC 27001:2013 is a security standard that formally specifies an Information Security Management System (ISMS) that is intended to bring information security under explicit management control. As a formal specification, it mandates requirements that define how to implement, monitor, maintain, and continually improve the ISMS. It also prescribes a set of best practices that include documentation requirements, divisions of responsibility, availability, access control, security, auditing, and corrective and preventive measures. Certification to ISO/IEC 27001:2013 helps organizations comply with numerous regulatory and legal requirements that relate to information security.

ISO/IEC 27001:2013 specifies the requirements for implementing, maintaining, monitoring, and continually improving an ISMS. ISO/IEC 27002:2013 provides guidelines and best practices for information security management; however, an organization cannot get certified against ISO/IEC 27002:2013 because it is not a management standard. The audit vehicle is ISO/IEC 27001:2013, which relies on detailed guidelines in ISO/IEC 27002:2013 for control implementation.

### Frequently asked questions

**Why is Office 365 compliance with ISO/IEC 27001 important?**

Compliance with these standards, confirmed by an accredited auditor, demonstrates that Microsoft uses internationally recognized processes and best practices to manage the infrastructure and organization that support and deliver its services. The certificate validates that Microsoft has implemented the guidelines and general principles for initiating, implementing, maintaining, and improving the management of information security.

**Where can I get the ISO/IEC 27001 audit reports and scope statements for Office 365 services?**

The [Service Trust Portal](/microsoft-365/compliance/get-started-with-service-trust-portal) provides independently audited compliance reports. You can use the portal to request reports so that your auditors can compare Microsoft's cloud services results with your own legal and regulatory requirements.

**Are annual tests run for Office 365 infrastructure failures?**

Yes. The annual ISO/IEC 27001 certification process for the Microsoft Cloud Infrastructure and Operations group includes an audit for operational resiliency. To view the latest certificate, select the link below.

**Where do I start my organization's own ISO/IEC 27001 compliance effort?**

Adopting ISO/IEC 27001 is a strategic commitment. As a starting point, consult the [ISO/IEC 27000 Directory](https://www.27000.org/index.htm).

**Can I use the ISO/IEC 27001 compliance of Office 365 services in my organization's certification?**

Yes. If your business requires ISO/IEC 27001 certification for implementations deployed on Microsoft services, you can use the applicable certification in your compliance assessment. You are responsible, however, for engaging an assessor to evaluate the controls and processes within your own organization and your implementation for ISO/IEC 27001 compliance.
