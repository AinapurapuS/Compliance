# System and Organization Controls (SOC) 1 Type 2

## SOC 1 Type 2 overview

System and Organization Controls (SOC) for Service Organizations are internal control reports created by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA). They're intended to examine services provided by a service organization so that end users can assess and address the risk associated with an outsourced service.

A SOC 1 Type 2 attestation is performed under:

- SSAE No. 18, Attestation Standards: Clarification and Recodification, which includes AT-C section 320, *Reporting on an Examination of Controls at a Service Organization Relevant to User Entities' Internal Control Over Financial Reporting* (AICPA, Professional Standards).
- SOC 1 Reporting on an Examination of Controls at a Service Organization Relevant to User Entities' Internal Control Over Financial Reporting (AICPA Guide).

Aside from the AICPA Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements 18 (SSAE 18), the Office 365 SOC 1 Type 2 audit is conducted in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements No. 3402 (ISAE 3402). The SOC 1 attestation has replaced SAS 70, and it's appropriate for reporting on controls at a service organization relevant to user entities internal controls over financial reporting. A Type 2 report includes auditor's opinion on the control effectiveness to achieve the related control objectives during the specified monitoring period.

### Frequently asked questions

**How often are Office 365 SOC reports issued?**

Microsoft commissions a full SOC 1 Type 2 and SOC 2 Type 2 examination of Office 365 annually. The auditor's reports on these examinations (also known as audits) are issued as soon as they are ready after that audit.  The SOC 3 report, which is based on the SOC 2 examination, is issued at the same time.

Because Microsoft doesn't control the investigative scope of the examination nor the timeframe of the auditor's completion, there's no set timeframe when these reports are issued. The reports are usually issued a few months after the end of the period under examination. Microsoft doesn't allow any gaps in the consecutive periods of examination from one examination to the next.

Microsoft also commissions a mid-year SOC 1 Type 1 and SOC 2 Type 1 examination of Office 365 for new Microsoft services that have been issued since the last SOC Type 2 audit. Type 1 audits don't look back over a period of performance.

Due to the sophisticated nature of Office 365, the service scope is large if examined as a whole. This can lead to examination completion delays due to scale. Microsoft organizes all the examinations described above into 2 categories: Core Services and Microservices. Microsoft issues reports scoped to each examination.

SOC Type 2 audits examine a rolling 12-month *run window* (also known as the audit period or more formally *period of performance*) with examinations conducted annually for the period 1-October through 30-September of the next calendar year. The examination starts promptly after the period of performance is complete.  

Microsoft also issues bridge letters (also known as *gap letters*). These are self-attestations by Microsoft, not reports based on examinations by the auditor. Bridge letters are issued during the current period of performance that isn't yet complete and ready for audit examination. Microsoft  issues bridge letters at the end of each quarter to attest our performance during the prior three-month period. Due to the period of performance for the SOC type 2 audits, the bridge letters are typically issued in December, March, June, and September of the current operating period.

**How can customers benefit from Office 365 SOC 1 Type 2 attestation?**

Customers can use the Office 365 SOC 1 Type 2 attestation when pursuing their own financial industry-specific compliance requirements such as Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX), Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC), Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA), and others.

**Where can I get the Office 365 SOC audit documentation including Microsoft's bridge letters?**

For links to audit documentation, see the audit report section of the [Service Trust Portal](https://servicetrust.microsoft.com/ViewPage/MSComplianceGuideV3). You must have an existing subscription or free trial account in Office 365 or Office 365 U.S. Government to log in. You can then download audit certificates, assessment reports, and other applicable documents to help you with your own regulatory requirements.

**Where can I see management responses to exceptions noted?**

Most examinations have some observations on one or more of the specific controls examined. This is to be expected. Management responses to any exceptions are located towards the end of the SOC attestation report. Search the document for 'Management Response'.

**Where can I see user entity responsibilities?**

User entity responsibilities are your control responsibilities necessary if the system as a whole is to meet the SOC 2 control standards. These are located at the very end of the SOC attestation report. Search the document for 'User Entity Responsibilities'.
