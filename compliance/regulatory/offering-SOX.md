# Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX)

## SOX overview

The [Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002](https://www.congress.gov/bill/107th-congress/house-bill/3763) (SOX) is a US federal law administered by the [Securities and Exchange Commission](https://www.sec.gov/) (SEC). Among other things, SOX requires publicly traded companies to have proper internal control structures in place to validate that their financial statements reflect their financial results accurately. SOX is heavily influenced by customerâ€™s internal processes especially when it comes to controls for financial reporting. For example, SOX requirements involve internal customer controls for the preparation and review of financial statements, and especially controls that affect accuracy, completeness, effectiveness, and public disclosure of material changes related to financial reporting.

The SEC does not define or impose a SOX certification process. Instead, it provides broad guidelines for publicly traded companies to determine how to comply with SOX reporting requirements.

## Microsoft and SOX

Microsoft cloud services customers subject to compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) can use the SOC 1 Type 2 attestation that Microsoft received from an independent auditing firm when addressing their own SOX compliance obligations. This attestation is appropriate for reporting on internal controls over financial reporting.

Even though there is no SOX certification or validation for cloud service providers, Microsoft can help customers meet their SOX obligations. For example, SOX requires internal controls for the preparation and review of financial statements, especially controls that affect the accuracy, completeness, effectiveness, and public disclosure of material changes related to financial reporting. To help companies, Microsoft maintains a SOC 1 Type 2 attestation appropriate for reporting on such controls across a broad portfolio of services that can be used to build a wide range of applications. It is based on the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements 18 (SSAE 18) and the International Standard on Assurance Engagements No. 3402 (ISAE 3402). (This attestation replaced SAS 70.)

The audit report, produced by a third-party auditing firm, attests that Microsoft controls were designed appropriately, in operation on a specified date, and operating effectively over a specified time period. Customers can review the reports to learn about Microsoft control objectives and the effectiveness of its controls, and get access to complementary controls.

At Microsoft, we share the responsibility of compliance with our customers. We supply the specifics about our compliance programs, which you can verify by requesting detailed audit results from the certifying third parties. Ultimately, however, it is up to you to determine whether our services comply with the specific laws and regulations applicable to your business. For example, there are SOX-related security controls, such as user access to cloud resources, that are your responsibility: your organization must develop appropriate auditing of these controls as part of your SOX compliance.

## Microsoft in-scope cloud platforms & services

## Azure, Dynamics 365, and SOX

As cloud adoption gains momentum, more and more customers are exploring how to migrate applications and workloads subject to SOX compliance obligations to the cloud. Even though there is no SOX certification or validation for cloud service providers, Azure can help you meet your SOX obligations.

If you are subject to SOX compliance obligations, you should review the Azure [SOC 1 Type 2 attestation](./offering-soc-1.md), which is performed according to:

- SSAE No. 18, Attestation Standards: Clarification and Recodification, which includes AT-C section 320, *Reporting on an Examination of Controls at a Service Organization Relevant to User Entities' Internal Control Over Financial Reporting* (AICPA, Professional Standards).
- SOC 1 Reporting on an Examination of Controls at a Service Organization Relevant to User Entities' Internal Control Over Financial Reporting (AICPA Guide).

The AICPA SSAE 18 standard replaced SAS 70, and it is appropriate for reporting on controls at a service organization relevant to user entities internal controls over financial reporting. This is the formal audit that you can rely on for third-party reviews of technology service providers when pursuing your own industry specific compliance obligations for assets deployed on Azure. It includes auditor's opinion on control effectiveness to achieve the related control objectives during the specified monitoring period.

Moreover, Azure has produced [guidance documentation](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/microsoft-azure-guidance-for-sarbanes-oxley-sox/) to help you use Azure's existing compliance reports when addressing your own SOX compliance obligations. It draws on internal Microsoft experience with migrating SOX relevant applications to Azure. Moreover, this guidance provides migration best practices, including SOX compliance implications, reviews of two publicly available case studies, and lessons learned from Microsoft's internal migration projects.
