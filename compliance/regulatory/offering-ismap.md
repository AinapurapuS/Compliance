# Information System Security Management and Assessment Program (ISMAP)

## ISMAP Overview

The Information system Security Management and Assessment Program (ISMAP) is a system to ensure an appropriate security level in government cloud service procurement by evaluating and registering cloud services that meet the security requirements of the Japanese government in advance, and thereby enabling the smooth introduction of cloud services.

The program was officially announced on May 26, 2020, and various information is available on the official website of the Information-technology Promotion Agency, Japan (IPA).

In the program, a total of 1,600 items, consisting of governance standards, management standards and control measures standards, must be audited by a third-party auditing firm.
