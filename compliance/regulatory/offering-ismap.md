# Information System Security Management and Assessment Program (ISMAP)

## ISMAP overview

The Information System Security Management and Assessment Program (ISMAP) is a cloud services assessment program administered by the Japanese government. The program was officially announced on 26 May 2020, and it was designed to ensure appropriate security in government cloud services procurement by evaluating and registering cloud services that meet the Japanese government security requirements. Cloud service providers who intend to participate in public sector procurement programs can apply for ISMAP certification that is administered by an independent third-party auditing firm approved by ISMAP. Japanese government agencies can then procure cloud services from cloud service providers registered with ISMAP instead of conducting their own individual assessments.

For more information about ISMAP, see the official [ISMAP web site](https://www.ismap.go.jp/csm).
